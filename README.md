# CS-GO-Winner-Classification

This simple project is to practice on classification problems, and apply Principle Component Analysis on a relatively high-dimensional dataset. This is also a cool practice for gamers like me!

## Problem Definition

Given a set of features that happened in a round of CS:GO match, how well can we predict which team would win a round?
